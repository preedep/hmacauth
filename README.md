# HMACAUTH
HMACAUTH is demo project for test HMAC Authentication , I've split the project into three parts:
- HMACAUTH-LIB : A library that contains the HMAC Authentication logic.
- HMACUTH-WASM : A WebAssembly project that uses the HMACAUTH-LIB to authenticate a request.
- HMACAUTH-WEB : A Web project that uses the HMACAUTH-LIB to authenticate a request.
